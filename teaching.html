    <h2 > The Roots of My Passion for Teaching</h2>

<body>

<p <align=”justify”>
   <p> I got connected to teaching since when I was very young. My mother who is now retired, used to be a Persian literature teacher back in Iran. I think this was a very invaluable experience for me to see how teaching happens from behind the scenes. I could see the passion and efforts my mother put in her teaching and this caused me to always have a deep respect and appreciation for my teachers. I remember this mindset about teaching helped me be patient and observant of the different teaching methods I was exposed to.
</p>
<p>I always <i>chose</i>  to study hard and this made it very easy for me to make the most out of effective teaching styles. On the other hand, I tried to have a mental archive of teaching practices that were less effective, unfair, or sometimes inaccurate. I realized the latter usually when I had passed the class. I continued following teaching profiles more closely when I started my undergraduate studies in pure chemistry. While finishing my degree I started preparing for the master's degree entrance exam in Iran, which is comprehensive and includes English, physical, analytical, organic, and inorganic chemistry questions. At this point, I had some teaching assistance experience and I could tell what teaching styles have been effective for me in my chemistry studies.
</p>
<p>As an undergraduate who was about to start his master's degree, I could summarize my thinking about effective teaching styles for myself. I became more interested in the course, worked harder, did better in exams when the instructor $\diamond$ had a professional and caring attitude  $\diamond$ was organized and well-prepared, $\diamond$ designed assessments that were in line with what was taught in the class, <span>&#10211;</span> used different methods of presentation, <span>&#9672;</span> provided real-world examples about the discussions, and $\diamond$ invested enough time on problem-solving skills.
