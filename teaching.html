    <h2 > The Roots of My Passion for Teaching</h2>

<body>

<p <align=”justify”>
   <p> I got connected to teaching since when I was very young. My mother who is now retired, used to be a Persian literature teacher back in Iran. I think this was a very invaluable experience for me to see how teaching happens from behind the scenes. I could see the passion and efforts my mother put in her teaching and this caused me to always have a deep respect and appreciation for my teachers. I remember this mindset about teaching helped me be patient and observant of the different teaching methods I was exposed to.
</p>
<p>I always <i>chose</i>  to study hard and this made it very easy for me to make the most out of effective teaching styles. On the other hand, I tried to have a mental archive of teaching practices that were less effective, unfair, or sometimes inaccurate. I realized the latter usually when I had passed the class. I continued following teaching profiles more closely when I started my undergraduate studies in pure chemistry. While finishing my degree I started preparing for the master's degree entrance exam in Iran, which is comprehensive and includes English, physical, analytical, organic, and inorganic chemistry questions. At this point, I had some teaching assistance experience and I could tell what teaching styles have been effective for me in my chemistry studies.
</p>
<p>As an undergraduate who was about to start his master's degree, I could summarize my thinking about effective teaching styles for myself. I became more interested in the course, worked harder, did better in exams when the instructor <span>&#10211;</span> had a professional and caring attitude  <span>&#10211;</span> was organized and well-prepared, <span>&#10211;</span> designed assessments that were in line with what was taught in the class, <span>&#10211;</span> used different methods of presentation, <span>&#10211;</span> provided real-world examples about the discussions, and <span>&#10211;</span> invested enough time on problem-solving skills.

<h2>Constructivism</h2>
<p>In my own teaching philosophy, I have tried to stay loyal to what I believe are effective teaching practices. I believe a good chemistry instructor should be familiar with learning theories and fundamental findings in Chemical Education Research that make teaching chemistry more effective. One of the most famous theories of learning is \textit{constructivism} and states that students integrate new knowledge into the pre-existing conceptions they have. <a> href="https://doi.org/10.1021/ed063p873">Bodner_1986</a> Knowing this has helped me not to have the preconceived notion that students are ``blank slates'' that can receive all the knowledge I want them to learn and I have to take into account the vital role of their background knowledge and pre-conceptions.</p>

<p>I have tried to incorporate other useful findings of Chemical Education Research into my teaching. Learning in students becomes more efficient when information is delivered to them in chunks. \cite{Johnstone2006} I always try to break down main topics into easier to understand sub-topics. Students need to be reminded about the scale that the chemistry is happening because there are differences in how students perceive the molecular level and how I see it. \cite{Johnstone1991} While explaining concepts, I try to remind students about the different scales that the chemistry is happening. For example, in lectures, if I am talking about melting of a crystalline solid while we discuss the \textit{macro}chemistry physical change, I will also draw a crystal lattice and explain that melting happens when the kinetic energy of molecules outweighs their \textit{inter}molecular attraction forces, at the \textit{micro}-level. In a laboratory setting, I will do the switch of the levels. For example, in recrystallization experiments, I will emphasize that the dissolution of a compound in a hot solvent at \textit{macro}-level, is the dissociation of its lattice at the \textit{micro}-level. </p>
