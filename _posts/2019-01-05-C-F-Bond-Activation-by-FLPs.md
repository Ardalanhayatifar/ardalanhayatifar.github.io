# Introduction
In their recent [article](https://doi.org/10.1039/C9DT04588K), Stephan _et al._ describe how a proazaphosphatrane P(MeNCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>N, can react with PHC(O)CF<sub>3</sub>. They first use this proazaphosphatrane , also known as "Verkadeâ€™s base", as an actual Lewis base and then test it in presence of a Lewis acid, with which it forms a Frustrated Lewis pair (FLP).

# Background: FLPs in C-F Activation
Stephan has previously shown that P/B FLP reacts with C-F bond containing compounds to
break it heterolytically.

# When the Lewis Base is used Without a Lewis Acid Present: No FLP
The Lewis base acts a very strong base at P and It reacts first by defluorinating the alpha fluorine of the first molecule of 
PHC(O)CF<sub>3</sub> to form a salt. Then the formed anion PHC(O)CF<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> attacks the second molecule of PHC(O)CF<sub>3</sub>. It just looks like an Aldol condensation but with fluorines instead of hydrogens. This intermediate could be
further verified by derivatizing it, by reacting it with R<sub>3</sub>SiCl.
