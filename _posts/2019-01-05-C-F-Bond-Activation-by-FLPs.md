# Introduction
In their recent [article](https://doi.org/10.1039/C9DT04588K), Stephan _et al._ describe how a proazaphosphatrane P(MeNCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>N, can react with PhC(O)CF<sub>3</sub>. They first use this proazaphosphatrane , also known as "Verkadeâ€™s base", as an actual Lewis base and then test it in presence of a Lewis acid, with which it forms a Frustrated Lewis pair (FLP).

# Background: FLPs in C-F Activation
Stephan has previously shown that P/B FLP reacts with C-F bond containing compounds to
break it heterolytically.

# When the Lewis Base is used Without a Lewis Acid Present: No FLP
The Lewis base acts a very strong base at P and It reacts first by defluorinating the alpha fluorine of the first molecule of 
PHC(O)CF<sub>3</sub> to form a salt. Then the formed anion PHC(O)CF<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> attacks the second molecule of PHC(O)CF<sub>3</sub>. It just looks like an Aldol condensation but with fluorines instead of hydrogens. This intermediate could be
further verified by derivatizing it, by reacting it with R<sub>3</sub>SiCl.

# The Reactivity of P(MeNCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>N When BPh<sub>3</sub> Is Present: FLP

Monitored by computational methods, in the presence of BPh<sub>3</sub>, proazaphosphatrane reversibly forms an FLP. This changes the reactivity of proazaphosphatrane
completely and it will act as a nucelophile for PHC(O)CF<sub>3</sub> to form __Int1/BPh<sub>3</sub>__. This intermediate
later does a C-P to C-O migration (rearrangement) and finally BPh<sub>3</sub> will abstract an F<sup>-</sup> to form __2__.

# Conclusions

> FLPs are able to intercept reaction intermediates.

The paper also later describes how using FLPs, the resulting enolates of acetophenone can be incorporated into a phosphonium cation or a borate anion. This is promising for accessing divergent synthetic solutions using FLPs.

The author is the founder of FLPs. This paper shows the vast potential 
of these species. especially in one of the most challenging bond activations (C-F bond). Looking at the 
DFT calculated reaction profile, the breaking of the C-F bond is the rate-determining step and it is safe to say that 
an actual C-F bond activation is happening. Again, it is interesting that the oxygen of carbonyl does not hinder the functionality of the FLP by acting as a Lewis base. Indeed, this is has been studied in details by Warren Piers in
[B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> catalyzed hydrosilation of carbonyl functions ](https://doi.org/10.1021/jo991828a).
