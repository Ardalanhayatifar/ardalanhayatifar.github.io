      <h3> X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) of Fe and S Species </h3>  
      <p>
        I started my postdoctoral work at the University <em>of</em> Saskatchewan by analyzing previously collected data from the SXRMB beamline at the Canadian Light Source (CLS). The data included standards and real samples with both Fe and S K-edge XAS measurements. Using Linear Combination Fitting (LCF), one can determine what standards constitute the measured samples. Fe-XAS has an interesting pre-edge feature that can give a lot of information on the coordination environment of Fe atoms.

    <p>
        Fitting this pre-edge feature allows determining the Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio:
