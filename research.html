<p <align=”justify”> I started my graduate studies synthesizing branched fluoro-oligogermanes. In the course of this project, I came across germanium cations (germyliums). I studied their immense Lewis acidity, and could apply them in hydrodefluorination (HDF) reactions. Currently, I am working on "impossible" substrates for main-group elements based HDF, and other innovative organic transformations by germanium compounds. Below, you can find summaries of some results from my projects.   </p>

<h3 id="synthesis-of-branched-fluoride">• Synthesis of the Elusive Branched Fluoro-oligogermane (Ph<sub>3</sub>Ge)<sub>3</sub>GeF</h3>

<p <align=”justify”> Our group was successful in making (Ph<sub>3</sub>Ge)<sub>3</sub>GeX (X=Cl, Br, I) compounds (<i>Organometallics</i> 2011, 30, 5, 1046-1058) but making the fluoride analogue proved to be harder. After several different attempts, the key to this elusive compound 
was found to be taking advantage of the extreme Lewis acidity of the germylium intermediate. Typically considered to be a weakly-coordinating anion (WCA), BF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, acted 
as an <i>in situ</i> fluoride source. Along with the anionic digermyne fluoride adduct with silver ions, made by Power <i>et al.</i> (<i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i> 2010, 132, 38, 13150-13151), (Ph<sub>3</sub>Ge)<sub>3</sub>GeF, are the 
only fully characterized compounds that have Ge-Ge and Ge-F bonds. Our attempts to isolate this germylium have been futile, but this reactive intermediate 
has given us insights into the potentials of germanium compounds in organic synthesis.

<h3 id="hdf">• HDF of Acid Fluorides and Organofluorines by Ph<sub>3</sub>GeH </h3>
<br />

<br /> 
<p <align=”justify”> Our continuing efforts for isolating the germylium intermediate, led us to examine the capability of the simpler germylium 
Ph<sub>3</sub>Ge<sup>+</sup> in C-F bond activation. In the previous project, 
we had realized that the branched germylium (Ph<sub>3</sub>Ge)<sub>3</sub>Ge<sup>+</sup> is able to activate C-X bond in CH<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> (X=Cl, Br, I).
Also, there have been reports about using germyliums in C-N, C-H bonds activation, small molecules activation and unusual Friedel–Crafts reactions. 
We have been able to show that Ph<sub>3</sub>GeH with catalytic amounts of [CPh<sub>3</sub>][B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>] can do HDF with 
acyl fluorides and organofluorines. This approach has proved to be simple and mild and can be carried out in neat conditions. Other significant
features of this method are, no over-reduction of acyl fluorides or partial HDF of organofluorines happen.
</p> 
<p <align=”justify”> My favorite part of this project is that several initial reactions were done by 10 high school students at the university of Detroit Jesuit high School (Detroit, MI).
Also, this article was featured as the cover art for the issue in which it was published.
