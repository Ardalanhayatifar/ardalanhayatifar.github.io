<h3>Short Bio</h3>

My name is Ardalan and I am from Iran. I was born in Tehran where I also did my undergrad and master's studies. I studied Chemistry at Shahid Beheshti University (also known as National University prior to 1979). In 2013, I entered the master's program in Nano-Chemistry at Iran University of Science and Technology.
