    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p <align=”justify”>
        My name is Ardalan and I was born in Tehran, Iran, where I also did my undergraduate and master's studies. 
        I moved to the US in 2016 and currently, I'm in the 4<sup>th</sup> year of my studies at Oklahoma state university. 
        In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing chess and hiking.
